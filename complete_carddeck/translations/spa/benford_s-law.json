  "Benford's Law": "Ley de Benford",
  "When you look at numbers found in real-world data sets, for most sets of numbers the first digit is more often a 1 than any other digit. 2 is a more common first digit than 3, and so on up to 9. In fact, the first digits often follow the same pattern (distribution).": "Cuando miras números que se encuentran en conjuntos de datos del mundo real, para la mayoría de los conjuntos de números, el primer dígito es más a menudo un 1 que cualquier otro dígito. 2 es un primer dígito más frecuente que 3 y así sucesivamente hasta 9. De hecho, los primeros dígitos suelen seguir el mismo patrón (distribución).",
  "Have a look at some data sets that span many orders of magnitude. For example, what are the first digits of: the first 100 prime numbers (or more!), the populations of the countries in Africa, the heights of the tallest buildings in the world?": "Echa un vistazo a algunos conjuntos de datos que abarcan muchos órdenes de magnitud. Por ejemplo, ¿cuáles son los primeros dígitos de: los primeros 100 números primos (¡o más!), las poblaciones de los países de África, las alturas de los edificios más altos del mundo?",
  "Many data sets (for example, populations of countries, heights of buildings, stock prices) or famous sequences (Fibonacci numbers, prime numbers) are spread over very different scales (orders of magnitude). Many of these big sets of data arise from decreasing power laws. A simple example might be": "Muchos conjuntos de datos (por ejemplo, poblaciones de países, alturas de edificios, precios de acciones) o secuencias famosas (números de Fibonacci, números primos) se distribuyen en escalas (órdenes de magnitud) muy diferentes. Muchos de estos grandes conjuntos de datos surgen de leyes de potencias decrecientes. Un ejemplo sencillo podría ser",

  "Power laws will look like a straight line on semi-log graph paper - where the y-axis is on a log-scale paper. We can show this by rewriting our formula for the power law y = k×10⁽⁻ᵃˣ⁾ = 10ᵇ×10⁽⁻ᵃˣ⁾ = 10⁽⁻ᵃˣ⁺ᵇ⁾ , and then applying a logarithm on both sides: log₁₀(y) = - a×x + b. This is the equation when the y-axis is on a log scale.

  "Try picking random values of x, and reading off corresponding values of y from our (power law) straight line. Because of the spacing of the horizontal lines we see that we are most likely to get a value of y with first digit 1, then we are next likely to get a value of y with a first digit 2, etc. These probabilities are what leads to Benford's Law.": "Try picking random values of x, and reading off corresponding values of y from our (power law) straight line.
