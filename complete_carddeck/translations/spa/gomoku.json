  "Start by drawing a square grid of 15 by 15 lines. Two players take it in turns to place a counter on any point where lines cross. The player who gets five of their counters in a straight line wins. The line can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal.": "Comienza dibujando una cuadrícula de 15 por 15 líneas. Dos jugadores se turnan para colocar una ficha en cualquier punto donde se crucen las líneas. El jugador que consigue colocar cinco de sus fichas en línea recta, vertical, horizontal o diagonal, gana.",
  "This game is traditionally played with black and white counters, but you could use any different counters, or little pieces of paper. You could also draw the grid in pen and then use pencil to mark x or o for each player and then rub them out when you are finished to be able to use the grid again.": "Este juego tradicionalmente se juega con fichas negras y blancas, pero puedes usar cualquier ficha diferente o pequeños pedazos de papel. También puedes dibujar la cuadrícula con lapicera y luego usar un lápiz para marcar \"x\" o \"o\" para cada jugador; así, al terminar el juego, los puedes borrar y volver a usar la cuadrícula nuevamente.",
  "It is very important to be watching your opponents moves as well as trying to make a line of 5 yourself. If your opponent has three in a row with nothing at either end - this is called \"open 3\" - then it is a good idea to use your turn to block one end. If they manage to get \"open 4\" you have certainly lost! A good attacking strategy might be to aim for two overlapping lines of open 3s - like a cross - so that it is very hard for your opponent to defend.": "It is very important to be watching your opponents moves as well as trying to make a line of 5 yourself.

  "There is a World Championship tournament for Gomuku. Since 2009 it has used the Swap 2 rule to make it a fair game, no matter who starts. There are also championships for computers to play at Gomuku! So people write an artificial intelligence program and their program plays against someone else's program to see who wins. There are also computer vs. human competitions - in 2017 a computer called Yixin beat the world champion human player Rudolf Dupszki 2-0.": "There is a World Championship tournament for Gomuku.
