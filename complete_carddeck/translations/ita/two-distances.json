That will give you three points that are all the same distance from each other. Where could you put the fourth point?",
  "If we call the two distances \"short\" and \"long\", then any such drawing of points must have a triangle with one long and two short edges (it's not quite obvious, but if you think about it a bit you can eliminate all other possibilities). Now where does the last point go? To each of the other 3 points, it's connected either via a long or a short edge, giving 8 possibilities. Try out each of them, you will notice that 2 of them do not work out, leaving 6 solutions.": "If we call the two distances \"short\" and \"long\", then any such drawing of points must have a triangle with one long and two short edges (it's not quite obvious, but if you think about it a bit you can eliminate all other possibilities).
