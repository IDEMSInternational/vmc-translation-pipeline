If we think about the sequence of 2 + 5 = 7 steps (S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, and S7), then the problem is equivalent to counting how many ways you select 2 objects (the positions of the two steps towards north) from a total of 7 objects (the total number of positions of the steps). There are 7 possibilities to select the position for the first step towards north; then there are 7 - 1 = 6 possibilities to select the position of the second step towards north (\"-1\" because one position has already been selected), therefore you get 6×7 = 42.
