  "This problem is firstly meant to make you think about a good strategy to count. You can draw all possibilities for shorter paths. However, this will soon become too lengthy. A first step towards finding an organizing principle could be classifying the paths accordingly to how many pairs of \nslabs placed lengthwise there are. Let us denote as n the number of paving slabs.\nFor n = 1, there is clearly only one possibility (no pairs); for n = 2 there are 2 possibilities (no pairs, and 1 pair); for n = 3 there are 1×(no pairs) + 2×(1 pair) = 3 ways; for n = 4 there are 1×(no pairs) + 3×(1 pair) + 1×(2 pairs)= 5. Using this strategy we can easily count n = 6: there are 1×(no pairs) + 5×(1 pair) + 6×(2 pairs) + 1×(3 pairs) = 13. Looking at the sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, …you might recognize the pattern!": "This problem is firstly meant to make you think about a good strategy to count.

  "Supposing you have to lay n slabs. Let us denote as F(n) the solution of the problem for n slabs. There are two ways you can end your path: either by laying the last pair of slabs lengthwise, or by laying the last slab across. In the first case, you are free to arrange the first (n - 2) slabs as you wish to make a path of length (n - 2) meters: there are exactly F(n - 2) ways of doing this. As far as the second case is concerned, you are then free to arrange the first (n - 1) slabs as you wish to make a path of length (n - 1) meters: there are exactly F(n - 1) ways of doing this. Therefore, you find that F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2): this is the proof for the recursion relation for your sequence of numbers! By previous experiments, it should be clear that F(1) = 1 and F(2) = 2.\nWe can now build the sequence easily: each term in the sequence can be found by adding the two previous terms.
