  "On the back of the number 8 there must be the number 7. The sheet below must have the numbers 6 and 5. Keeping going there will be 4 and 3 and finally 2 and 1. So there are three sheets underneath. Adding on 7 to the 61 gives the last page as 68. Given each sheet has four pages, there are 68 ∕ 4 = 17 sheets.": "On the back of the number 8 there must be the number 7. The sheet below must have the numbers 6 and 5.

  "There are 9 one-digit numbers (the numbers 1 - 9), 90 two-digit numbers (the numbers 10 - 99) and 900 three-digits numbers (the numbers 100 - 999). Altogether this would make 9×1 + 90×2 + 900×3 = 9 + 180 + 2700 = 2889 digits, so the number of pages is less than 999. There are 852 - 9 - 180 = 663 digits used in three digit numbers. 663 ∕ 3 = 221, so there are 221 pages with three digit numbers. 99 + 221 = 320 gives us the answer.": "There are 9 one-digit numbers (the numbers 1 - 9), 90 two-digit numbers (the numbers 10 - 99) and 900 three-digits numbers (the numbers 100 - 999).

  "Think about the numbers under 100 first. There are 10 numbers ending in 9, and 10 numbers having 9 as their upper digit (90‒99), making for a total of 20 9s. In the same way, we have 20 9s between 100 and 199, and between 200 and 299, etc. So we get 9×20 = 180 9s up to 899. We need 20 more to reach 200 9s. From 900‒999, every number has a 9 at the beginning. Because 909 has two 9s, we get the last 20 9s from the numbers from 900‒918.": "Think about the numbers under 100 first.
