For the Queens in the first round the students to receive one will be in position 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, ..., 999, then it will be 2, 5, 8, ..., 998 and then 1,4,7, ..., 997, 1000, and back to 3, 6, 9, ..., 999.  So every third time she will get a Queen. Because 1000 ∕ 3 is 333 with a remainder of 1, she will get one on the 1000ᵗʰ turn too. So 1000 + 334 = 1334 is the total number of cards.": "There are an even number of children so the sixth child will always be in a position on each turn to receive a Jack.
