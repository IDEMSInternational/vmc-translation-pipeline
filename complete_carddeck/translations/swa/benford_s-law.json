  "When you look at numbers found in real-world data sets, for most sets of numbers the first digit is more often a 1 than any other digit. 2 is a more common first digit than 3, and so on up to 9. In fact, the first digits often follow the same pattern (distribution).": "When you look at numbers found in real-world data sets, for most sets of numbers the first digit is more often a 1 than any other digit. 2 is a more common first digit than 3, and so on up to 9.

  "Power laws will look like a straight line on semi-log graph paper - where the y-axis is on a log-scale paper. We can show this by rewriting our formula for the power law y = k×10⁽⁻ᵃˣ⁾ = 10ᵇ×10⁽⁻ᵃˣ⁾ = 10⁽⁻ᵃˣ⁺ᵇ⁾ , and then applying a logarithm on both sides: log₁₀(y) = - a×x + b. This is the equation when the y-axis is on a log scale.
