  "Birthday Probability": "Uwezekano wa Siku ya Kuzaliwa",
  "In a room with 23 people the probability that two people have the same birthday is more than 50%.": "Katika chumba kilicho na watu 23, uwezekano kwamba watu wawili wana siku moja ya kuzaliwa ni zaidi ya 50%.",
  "The probability that two people have the same birthday is just 1 minus the probability of everyone's birthday being different.": "Uwezekano kwamba watu wawili wana siku moja ya kuzaliwa ni 1 tu ukiondoa uwezekano wa siku ya kuzaliwa ya kila mtu kuwa tofauti.",
  "You should ask yourself the following questions:": "Unapaswa kujiuliza maswali yafuatayo:",
  "If we only have 2 people what is the probability their birthday is different?": "Ikiwa tuna watu 2 tu kuna uwezekano gani siku yao ya kuzaliwa ni tofauti?",
  "If we had 5 people, in how many ways can we select two to compare their birthdays?": "Ikiwa tungekuwa na watu 5, ni kwa njia ngapi tunaweza kuchagua wawili ili kulinganisha siku zao za kuzaliwa?",
  "What do we get if we use the same approach for 23 people?": "Je, tunapata nini ikiwa tunatumia mbinu sawa kwa watu 23?",
  "The probability of any 2 people having different birthdays is roughly 364 ∕ 365. There are 253 different pairs of people in a room of 23 people, so the probability of them all having different birthdays is roughly 364 ∕ 365 to the power 253. This is 0.4995 slightly less than 50% so the probability of having 2 people in the room with the same birthday is just over 50%. Actually we should be including leap years but the result is still true if you do.": "Uwezekano wa watu 2 kuwa na siku tofauti za kuzaliwa ni takriban 364 ∕ 365. Kuna jozi 253 tofauti za watu katika chumba cha watu 23, kwa hivyo uwezekano wa wote kuwa na siku tofauti za kuzaliwa ni takriban 364 ∕ 365 kwa nguvu 253. Ndio ni 0.4995 chini kidogo ya 50% kwa hivyo uwezekano wa kuwa na watu 2 kwenye chumba na siku sawa ya kuzaliwa ni zaidi ya 50%. Kwa kweli tunapaswa kujumuisha miaka mirefu lakini matokeo bado ni kweli ukifanya hivyo.",
  "This problem is not a paradox but it is counter-intuitive. The number of people needed seems surprisingly small, perhaps because we imagine ourselves as one of the people in the room and think of only 22 possibilities for a match, rather than thinking of the 253 different pairs of people in the room.": "Tatizo hili si kitendawili bali ni kinyume cha angavu. Idadi ya watu wanaohitajika inaonekana kuwa ndogo kwa kushangaza, labda kwa sababu tunajiwazia kama mmoja wa watu katika chumba na kufikiria uwezekano 22 tu wa mechi, badala ya kufikiria jozi 253 tofauti za watu kwenye chumba.",
  "You can extend the birthday problem - you would only need 88 people to have a greater than 50% chance of 3 people sharing a birthday.": "Unaweza kupanua tatizo la siku ya kuzaliwa - utahitaji watu 88 pekee kuwa na nafasi kubwa ya 50% ya watu 3 kushiriki siku ya kuzaliwa.",
  "Have you experienced a surprising coincidence in your life?": "Je, umepata tukio la kushangaza katika maisha yako?",
  "Coincidences like meeting someone with exactly the same birthday as you are unlikely events on their own. However, as with the birthday problem, the number of events can increase exponentially meaning that in a group or over time it is more likely to have coincidences than not!": "Sadfa kama vile kukutana na mtu aliye na siku ya kuzaliwa sawa kabisa na wewe kuna uwezekano wa matukio ya peke yako. Walakini, kama ilivyo kwa shida ya siku ya kuzaliwa, idadi ya matukio inaweza kuongezeka kwa kasi ikimaanisha kuwa katika kikundi au baada ya muda kuna uwezekano mkubwa wa kuwa na bahati mbaya!",
  "If you haven't had a coincidence yet don't worry. If you keep looking it's unlikely that nothing unlikely will ever happen to you!": "Ikiwa haujapata bahati mbaya bado usijali. Ukiendelea kuangalia kuna uwezekano kwamba hakuna jambo lisilowezekana litakalowahi kutokea kwako!",
  "If there are 50 people in a room, what is the chance that two people share a birthday?": "Ikiwa kuna watu 50 katika chumba, kuna nafasi gani kwamba watu wawili wanashiriki siku ya kuzaliwa?",
  "Think about these questions:": "Fikiria maswali haya:",
  "How many possible pairs of people are there with 50 people in the room?": "Je, kuna jozi ngapi za watu zinazowezekana na watu 50 kwenye chumba?",
  "What is the chance that every pair of people have different birthdays to each other?": "Kuna nafasi gani kwamba kila jozi ya watu wana siku tofauti za kuzaliwa kwa kila mmoja?",
  "The number of pairs of people are 50x49 ∕ 2 = 1225. Chance of a unique pair is 364 ∕ 365. Chance of 1225 unique pairs is (364 ∕ 365)¹²²⁵ = 0.0347. Chance of at least one match is 1 - 0.0347 = 0.9653, which is 96.53%. So, incredibly likely!": "Idadi ya jozi za watu ni 50x49 ∕ 2 = 1225. Uwezekano wa jozi ya kipekee ni 364 ∕ 365. Uwezekano wa jozi 1225 za kipekee ni (364 ∕ 365)¹²²⁵ = 0.0347. Nafasi ya angalau mechi moja ni 1 - 0.0347 = 0.9653, ambayo ni 96.53%. Hivyo, incredibly uwezekano!"
