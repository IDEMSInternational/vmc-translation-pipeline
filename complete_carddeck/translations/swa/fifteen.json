  "This is a game for two players (or a group split into two teams). Take the A and 2 to 9 cards of any suit and place them face up in order. A = 1 in this game. Take it in turns to choose one of the cards and place it in front of you. The first player that has exactly three cards that add up to 15 is the winner. You can have more than three cards, but you only win if three of them add up to 15.": "Huu ni mchezo wa wachezaji wawili (au kikundi kimegawanywa katika timu mbili). Chukua kadi A na 2 hadi 9 za suti yoyote na uziweke zimeelekea juu kwa mpangilio. A = 1 katika mchezo huu. Chukua kwa zamu kuchagua moja ya kadi na kuiweka mbele yako. Mchezaji wa kwanza ambaye ana kadi tatu haswa zinazojumlisha hadi 15 ndiye mshindi. Unaweza kuwa na zaidi ya kadi tatu, lakini utashinda tu ikiwa tatu kati yao zitaongezwa hadi 15.",
  "Remember you can't use two numbers to make 15, you can't use four numbers, it must be three numbers. You can have more than three cards in your hand and use only 3 of them. The game is a draw if all the cards have been chosen and nobody can make 15.": "Kumbuka huwezi kutumia namba mbili kufanya 15, huwezi kutumia namba nne, lazima iwe namba tatu. Unaweza kuwa na zaidi ya kadi tatu mkononi mwako na utumie 3 tu kati yao. Mchezo ni wa sare ikiwa kadi zote zimechaguliwa na hakuna mtu anayeweza kutengeneza 15.",
  "Write down all the combinations of three numbers that add up to 15. How can you be sure that you have found all the combinations? Which numbers appear in 2, 3, and 4 of these combinations?": "Andika michanganyiko yote ya nambari tatu zinazoongeza hadi 15. Unawezaje kuwa na uhakika kwamba umepata michanganyiko yote? Ni nambari gani zinazoonekana katika 2, 3, na 4 kati ya michanganyiko hii?",
  "Think about other games you might have played that this is similar to. Is it an advantage to go first or second?": "Fikiria kuhusu michezo mingine ambayo huenda umecheza ambayo hii inafanana nayo. Je, ni faida kwenda kwanza au pili?",
  "This game is interesting because it is the same as the game tic-tac-toe/naughts and crosses. The technical term for this is <em>isomorphic</em>. In mathematics it is often helpful, when faced with a new problem, to relate it to one you already know how to solve.": "Mchezo huu ni wa kuvutia kwa sababu ni sawa na mchezo wa tic-tac-toe/naughts na krosi. Neno la kiufundi kwa hili ni <em>isomorphic</em>. Katika hisabati mara nyingi husaidia, unapokabiliwa na tatizo jipya, kuhusisha na moja ambayo tayari unajua jinsi ya kutatua.",
  "Try playing the game again, but with the cards arranged like this to start with.": "Jaribu kucheza mchezo tena, lakini kwa kadi zilizopangwa kama hii kuanza.",
  "What do you notice about the way the numbers are arranged? Does it remind you of any other game?": "Unaona nini kuhusu jinsi nambari zinavyopangwa? Je, inakukumbusha mchezo mwingine wowote?"
