  "Start by drawing a square grid of 15 by 15 lines. Two players take it in turns to place a counter on any point where lines cross. The player who gets five of their counters in a straight line wins. The line can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal.": "Anza kwa kuchora gridi ya mraba ya mistari 15 kwa 15. Wachezaji wawili hupokeana kwa zamu ili kuweka kaunta mahali popote ambapo mistari huvuka. Mchezaji anayepata kaunta tano katika mstari ulionyooka atashinda. Mstari unaweza kuwa wima, usawa au diagonal.",
  "This game is traditionally played with black and white counters, but you could use any different counters, or little pieces of paper. You could also draw the grid in pen and then use pencil to mark x or o for each player and then rub them out when you are finished to be able to use the grid again.": "Mchezo huu kwa kawaida huchezwa na vihesabio nyeusi na nyeupe, lakini unaweza kutumia vihesabio vyovyote tofauti, au vipande vidogo vya karatasi. Unaweza pia kuchora gridi ya taifa kwa kalamu na kisha kutumia penseli kuweka alama ya x au o kwa kila mchezaji na kisha kuzisugua ukimaliza ili kuweza kutumia gridi tena.",
  "It is very important to be watching your opponents moves as well as trying to make a line of 5 yourself. If your opponent has three in a row with nothing at either end - this is called \"open 3\" - then it is a good idea to use your turn to block one end. If they manage to get \"open 4\" you have certainly lost! A good attacking strategy might be to aim for two overlapping lines of open 3s - like a cross - so that it is very hard for your opponent to defend.": "Ni muhimu sana kuwatazama wapinzani wako wanavyosonga na pia kujaribu kutengeneza safu ya 5 wewe mwenyewe. Ikiwa mpinzani wako ana tatu mfululizo bila chochote mwisho - hii inaitwa \"wazi 3\" - basi ni wazo nzuri kutumia zamu yako kuzuia mwisho mmoja. Wakifanikiwa kupata \"open 4\" hakika umepoteza! Mbinu nzuri ya kushambulia inaweza kuwa kulenga mistari miwili inayopishana ya 3s wazi - kama krosi - ili iwe ngumu sana kwa mpinzani wako kulinda.",
  "There is a World Championship tournament for Gomuku. Since 2009 it has used the Swap 2 rule to make it a fair game, no matter who starts. There are also championships for computers to play at Gomuku! So people write an artificial intelligence program and their program plays against someone else's program to see who wins. There are also computer vs. human competitions - in 2017 a computer called Yixin beat the world champion human player Rudolf Dupszki 2-0.": "Kuna mashindano ya ubingwa wa Dunia kwa Gomuku. Tangu 2009 imetumia sheria ya Badilisha 2 ili kuufanya mchezo wa haki, bila kujali ni nani anayeanza. Pia kuna michuano ya kompyuta kucheza Gomuku! Kwa hivyo watu huandika programu ya kijasusi ya bandia na programu yao inacheza dhidi ya programu ya mtu mwingine ili kuona nani atashinda. Pia kuna kompyuta dhidi ya. mashindano ya wanadamu - mnamo 2017 kompyuta iitwayo Yixin ilimshinda bingwa wa dunia mchezaji wa binadamu Rudolf Dupszki 2-0.",
  "For advanced players, the first player has a big advantage. This advantage can be removed by starting the game using the \"Swap 2\" rule. Let's say at the start of the game player one is crosses (x) and player two is circles (o).": "Kwa wachezaji wa hali ya juu, mchezaji wa kwanza ana faida kubwa. Faida hii inaweza kuondolewa kwa kuanza mchezo kwa kutumia sheria ya \"Swap 2\". Wacha tuseme mwanzoni mwa mchezo mchezaji mmoja ni misalaba (x) na mchezaji wa pili ni miduara (o).",
  "Player one begins the game by marking 3 intersections (two with x, and one with o), player two then chooses one of these three options (i) they take crosses, ending their turn (player one becomes circles and it is now their go), (ii) they stay as circles and add one circle as normal, (iii) they add two circles to the board, but then player one now gets to decide whether they want to steal circles. After this, play as normal.": "Mchezaji wa kwanza anaanza mchezo kwa kuweka alama 3 za makutano (mbili kwa x, na moja na o), mchezaji wa pili kisha anachagua moja ya chaguzi hizi tatu (i) wanachukua misalaba, wakimaliza zamu yao (mchezaji wa kwanza anakuwa miduara na sasa ni safari yao.), (ii) wanakaa kama miduara na kuongeza duara moja kama kawaida, (iii) wanaongeza miduara miwili kwenye ubao, lakini mchezaji mmoja sasa anapata kuamua kama wanataka kuiba miduara. Baada ya hayo, cheza kama kawaida."
