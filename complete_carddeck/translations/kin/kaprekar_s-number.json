  "We can write a three digit number abc (imagine it is as big as possible) as 100×a + 10×b + c. If we rearrange the digits to make it as small as possible it would be cba which we can write as 100×c + 10×b + a. We then subtract to give 100×a + 10×b + c - (100×c + 10×b + a) = 99×a - 99×c = 99×(a - c). So after one step, the number will be a multiple of 99. The only 3 digit numbers that are multiples of 99 are 099, 198, 297, 396, 495, 594, 693, 792, 891, and 990. We only need to check the first five of these (as we will be rearranging the digits anyway) and we can verify that all of them end up giving the answer 495.": "We can write a three digit number abc (imagine it is as big as possible) as 100×a + 10×b + c.
