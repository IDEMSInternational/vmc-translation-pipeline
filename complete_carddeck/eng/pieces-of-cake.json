Remember it doesn't say that the pieces have to be the same size! What happens if many cuts pass through the same point?",
  "With one cut you always get 2 pieces. With two cuts you can get 4 pieces. With three cuts, if all cuts pass through the same point you get 6 pieces. However, you can get 7 pieces if the third cut doesn't pass through the same point as the previous two. Use this idea to get the maximum number with four cuts. So to get the most pieces, make sure that no more than two cuts pass through the same point, otherwise you get less pieces. With four cuts you can get 11 pieces. Do the same again for five cuts, start with the four cuts that give 7 pieces and add a cut without passing through any meeting points (intersections) and you can get 16 pieces.": "With one cut you always get 2 pieces.

  "You might realise that there is a formula for obtaining the next number in the sequence from the previous one. You can see this by working out the number of new pieces created when you add an extra cut. For example, adding a fourth cut to 7 pieces obtained from 3 cuts adds 4 new pieces (11). Adding a fifth cut to this adds 5 new pieces (16).

  "This problem is related to the number of regions (pieces of the cake) in a plane bounded by a generic configuration of lines (cuts). \"Generic\" means that there are no parallel lines and that no more than two lines intersect in the same points.

Given C lines on a plane (in a generic configuration), then adding an extra line such that it intersects all the previous lines would create (C+1) new regions (around each intersection point of the new line with the previous ones, we add two new regions. However, one of the two is counted also in the next intersection point).
