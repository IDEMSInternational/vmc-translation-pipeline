  "Another way to think about it is if you are one of the 8 children, you need to shake hands with the 7 other people. So does every other child at the party. Since there are 8 of you, and you each shake hands with 7 other people, there should be 8\u00d77 handshakes. However, as it takes 2 people to shake hands we have counted each handshake twice. So we divide by two and the answer is 8\u00d77 \u2215 2 = 28": "Another way to think about it is if you are one of the 8 children, you need to shake hands with the 7 other people.

  "This is a classic puzzle that has been around for many years. There are many problem-solving strategies that can be used to find the solution - act it out, draw a diagram, look for a pattern, solve a simpler problem, make an organized list, make a table, use logical reasoning, . . . . The solution has deep mathematical properties and is a key result in the field of combinatorics. The number of handshakes is always a <strong>triangular number</strong>.

Multiplying by two gives us n\u00d7(n - 1) = 57360. Notice that we roughly want n\u00d7n = 57360 so try taking the square root of 57360.
