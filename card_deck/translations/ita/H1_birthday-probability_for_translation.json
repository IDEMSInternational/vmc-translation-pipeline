This is 0.4995 slightly less than 50% so the probability of having 2 people in the room with the same birthday is just over 50%. Actually we should be including leap years but the result is still true if you do.": "La probabilità che 2 persone abbiano la stessa data di nascita è circa di 364/365. Ci sono 254 coppie diverse di persone in una stanza con 23 persone, quindi la probabilità che abbiano tutti date di nascita differenti è di circa 364/365 alla 253 ovvero 0,4995, poco meno del 50% quindi la probabilità che ci siano 2 persone nella stanza con la stessa data di nascita è di poco superiore al 50%.
