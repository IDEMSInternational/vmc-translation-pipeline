  "The probability that two people have the same birthday is just 1 minus the probability of everyone's birthday being different.": "La probabilidad de que dos personas cumplan años el mismo día es 1 menos la probabilidad de que todos cumplan años en diferentes días.",
  "You should ask yourself the following questions:": "Deberías hacerte las siguientes preguntas:",
  "If we only have 2 people what is the probability their birthday is different? ": "Si solo tenemos 2 personas, ¿cuál es la probabilidad de que cumplan años en diferentes días? ",
  "If we had 5 people, in how many ways can we select two to compare their birthdays?": "Si tuviéramos 5 personas, ¿de cuántas maneras diferentes podemos elegir dos de ellas para comparar sus fechas de cumpleaños?",
  "What do we get if we use the same approach for 23 people?": "¿Qué obtenemos si usamos el mismo enfoque para 23 personas?",
  "The probability of any 2 people having different birthdays is roughly 364 ∕ 365. There are 253 different pairs of people in a room of 23 people, so the probability of them all having different birthdays is roughly 364 ∕ 365 to the power 253. This is 0.4995 slightly less than 50% so the probability of having 2 people in the room with the same birthday is just over 50%. Actually we should be including leap years but the result is still true if you do.": "La probabilidad de que 2 personas cumplan años en días diferentes es de 364/365. Hay 253 pares diferentes de personas en una habitación con 23 personas, por lo que la probabilidad que todas ellas tengan diferentes fechas de cumpleaños es aproximadamente 364/365 elevado a la 253.° potencia. Esto es 0,4995, un poco menos del 50 %. Entonces, la probabilidad de que 2 personas cumplan años el mismo día en esa habitación es un poco más del 50 %. En realidad, deberíamos incluir a los años bisiestos, pero el resultado sigue siendo cierto si lo hacemos.",
  "If there are 50 people in a room, what is the chance that two people share a birthday?": "Si hay 50 personas en una habitación, ¿cuál es la probabilidad de que dos personas tengan la misma fecha de cumpleaños?",

  "The number of pairs of people are 50x49 ∕ 2 = 1225. Chance of a unique pair is 364 ∕ 365. Chance of 1225 unique pairs is (364 ∕ 365)¹²²⁵ = 0.0347. Chance of at least one match is 1 - 0.0347 = 0.9653, which is 96.53%. So, incredibly likely!": "The number of pairs of people are 50x49 ∕ 2 = 1225. Chance of a unique pair is 364 ∕ 365.

  "This problem is not a paradox but it is counter-intuitive. The number of people needed seems surprisingly small, perhaps because we imagine ourselves as one of the people in the room and think of only 22 possibilities for a match, rather than thinking of the 253 different pairs of people in the room.
