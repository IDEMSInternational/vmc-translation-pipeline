  "This puzzle is an example of a Latin square. Interestingly, if the problem had involved 6 ranks of playing cards it would have been impossible. But with 7 ranks it is quite easy to find a solution. Latin squares are used in medical trials to ensure every participant is allocated to each treatment for the same time period to prove which is the best treatment.": "Fumbo hili ni mfano wa mraba wa Kilatini. Inafurahisha, ikiwa shida ingehusisha safu 6 za kadi za kucheza isingewezekana. Lakini kwa safu 7 ni rahisi sana kupata suluhisho. Miraba ya Kilatini hutumiwa katika majaribio ya matibabu ili kuhakikisha kila mshiriki ametengewa kila matibabu kwa muda sawa ili kuthibitisha matibabu bora zaidi."
